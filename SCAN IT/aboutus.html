<h4><i> Our Mission: To impart value based higher education turning out good engineers, scientists and researchers who are at the same time good individuals and good citizens in order that they may become useful members of an enlightened humane society.

Computer science combines the intellectual challenge of a new discipline with the excitement of being part of an innovative and rapidly expanding technology.

The programs combine a very thorough preparation in the fundamentals of computing and related fields with the opportunity for more advanced work in Computer Science, Information Systems and Computational Science. Computing technology does not stand still. So, we need to develop and spread the necessary intellectual, practical and personal skills to adapt readily to future changes.

Our aim is to provide degree programmes which foster these adaptive skills.

Computer science is concerned with the design, modeling, analysis, and applications of computer-related systems. The programs provide comprehensive and integrated studies of subjects in computer system architecture, computer networks, distributed computer systems, programming languages and systems, information and data management, artificial intelligence, computer science theory, and computer vision and graphics.

Our Computer Engineering curriculum provides students with broad engineering knowledge that includes the hardware as well as the software aspects of computing devices and it is designed to provide each student with a solid foundation in the scientific, engineering, and societal aspects of computing that prepares the student for a career that can advance the creation and application of computing technologies for the benefit of society.

This program goals and objectives are to train the next generation of computer scientists and engineers with the broad scientific and technical skills needed for initial employment and a productive career in a rapidly changing environment to provide thorough grounding in mathematics and science as a foundation for an understanding of computer science, engineering, and many of the technical applications to which computers are applied, a common core knowledge of the principal areas of computer science (theory, algorithms, data structures, software design, concepts of programming languages, and computer architecture) and an understanding of the fundamentals of one engineering or computer applications discipline,

The ability to formulate and solve computer science and engineering problems, including design and analysis, conducting measurements, and evaluating trade-offs of functionality and cost, outstanding skills in programming and good engineering practices of software development, and CASE Tools

The ability to use modern design and analysis tools for implementing and evaluating hardware, software, and engineering designs Furthermore, the Department has well-equipped laboratory where students apply and verify the theories they cover in their classes.

						<h4><i>SASTRA leadership in technical education has helped establish synergetic relationships with multinational giants, international universities and research centers worldwide. Our mutual exchange programmes and technology transfer prepare our students for an diverse and technological world.

Well-equipped laboratories are essential for universities offering professional courses and frontier areas of research , particularly in computer science and engineering. Our university estabiulished a Sun Lab and a new embedded systems lab facility at a cost of Rs. 1.35 crores.

The TIFAC-CORE in Advanced computing and Information Processing at SASTRA is a success story of how academic institutions, government, and industry can collaborate to create a center of excellence. With high-end servers and required storage, along with streaming audio and video, the new Sun Lab facility once fully established will be a virtual classroom for students. The facility has the network storage capacity for the archives of the digital classes planned. The industry-standard software for the embedded systems design, VXWorks from the winddriver is also available in our university.

SASTRA signed several Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). An MoU was signed between Nanyang Technological University and SASTRA at NTU, Singapore. This MoU provides for joint research, faculty and student exchange in the area of embedded systems between the Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems (CHiPES) of Nanyang Technological University and TIFAC CORE at SASTRA.

The Semiconductor Complex of India Ltd, and TIFAC-CORE at SASTRA signed an MoU for training and research. VLSI circuitary designed at TIFAC-CORE at SASTRA will be tested at the .35 micron foundry of SCL.
